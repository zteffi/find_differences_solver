# Find differences solver
A small personal side project to solve kid's puzzles where you're supposed to find diffeneces between simillar images. Currently it doesn't detect differences itself, just adds visual cues to the user. Since it currently uses affine transformation without any additional processing, it's not robust to photographs from an angle.
